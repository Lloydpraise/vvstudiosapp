## **1. Our Commitment to You**

We work to help your business grow through better marketing and proven systems.
Our tools, guidance, and audits are designed to help you understand your numbers, improve your marketing plans, and boost your sales efforts.

However, **we do not guarantee any specific sales, numbers, or outcomes**.
Any projections shown in our app are based on market data and other businesses’ results. These are only estimates and may not match your real results.



## **2. Your Data and Privacy**

VV Studios runs fully on the cloud.
Your data is stored securely, and **no third party can access it** without your permission.

We use your data only to:

* Personalize your experience
* Improve our tools
* Deliver better results for your business

We will never sell your data or misuse it.


## **3. Payments and Refunds**

* All paid plans are charged **at the beginning of the month**.
* We **do not offer refunds** for any reason.
* We accept **online payments only**. No cash payments are allowed.

VV Studios has **no hidden charges**. You will never be billed for anything not listed on our official price list.



## **4. Free Plan**

Our free package is **free forever** with **no limits** on core features.

However:

* Help from our digital marketing agents is limited on the free plan.
* More support can be unlocked by upgrading to a paid package.


## **5. Content Creation Services**

Some content creation services may be done with the help of partner providers to make sure you get the best quality.

* Prices shown for these services depend on partner pricing and may change.
* All services that come **directly from VV Studios** will be clearly marked as “Offered by VV Studios.”


## **6. Referral and Review Verification**

We have a strict policy to prevent false reviews and misleading advertising.

When you submit a referral or request a review:

* We first check if the person is **a real customer** who has actually bought from you.
* If they have not purchased from you, the review request is rejected and cannot be downloaded or used.

This protects your business and keeps our platform honest.


## **7. Business Approval**

We keep a certain quality and standard on our platform.
For this reason, we may review and decide whether a business fits our criteria.

We reserve the right to:

* Accept or reject businesses
* Remove businesses that do not meet our standards
  This helps us maintain results for the businesses we work with.


## **8. Changes to These Terms**

We may update these Terms of Service from time to time.
When we do, we will update the date at the top of this page.
Continuing to use VV Studios means you accept the updated terms.
